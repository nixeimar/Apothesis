 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 * Apothesis is a generalized kinteic Monte Carlo Code for tackling realistic deposition porcesses
 * and more specificaly Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) processes.
 * It is developed in C++ and it is disrtibuted under GNU license.
 *
 *
 * \section install_sec Installation
 * Currently no special installations instructions are required.
 * A simple "make" should create the executable "Apothesis".
 * The Makefile was generated with qmake but the qt libradies are excluded.
