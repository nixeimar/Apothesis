#Create steps (alaways in the x-direaction - see above 1st number), number of steps 
#(e.g. if 10 each step will consist of two atoms), height difference (each step will increase by 20, so 1st step: 10, 2nd: 30, 3rd, 50 etc)

#Example of growth reaction. The 1sr reactant is tranformed to the 1st product, the 2nd reactan to the 2nd product etc. 
#If #Reactants > #Products then only the first Nth reactants are tranformed to the (N-x) reactants. 
#Products that have "*" stay on the lattice (adsorbed) 
#products that do not have "*" are assumed to desorb instantly.
